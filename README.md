# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize different sorting algorithms. It allows users to generate a random array and see how various sorting algorithms work step-by-step.

## Features

- Visualize common sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- Generate random arrays for sorting.
- Real-time visualization of sorting processes.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Tkinter for the GUI
- Matplotlib for visualization
- NumPy for generating random arrays

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation


 Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib numpy
    ```

### Running the Application
